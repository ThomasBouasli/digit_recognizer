# Digit Recognizer Neural Network

This is a simple neural network that recognizes digits from the MNIST dataset. The neural network is implemented in Python using the numpy library. The neural network has one hidden layer with 10 neurons and uses the reLu activation function. The neural network is trained using the backpropagation algorithm.

For sake of comparison, the neural network is also implemented using tensorflow and keras. The neural network implemented using tensorflow and keras has the same architecture as the neural network implemented using numpy, and is slightly more accurate.
